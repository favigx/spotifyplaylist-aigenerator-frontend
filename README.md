# React + TypeScript + Vite

A project integrating Stripe, Spotify, and OpenAI APIs to generate AI-curated playlists based on user prompts.

Overview

This project allows users to create personalized Spotify playlists by entering a natural language prompt. For example:

"Create a playlist with 20 songs that resemble Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd."

The OpenAI API processes the prompt and generates a list of recommended songs. The Spotify API then searches for these songs, creates a new playlist, and adds the recommended tracks to it. Additionally, Stripe integration is included for potential monetization or premium features.
